> pilet-hello-world-generator

:zap: Very simple generator to be used in the official Piral Feed Service Pro edition.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

then package everything up and put it in your configured generator directory. If the path to the generators is `/data/generators` then you could put this one into `/data/generators/hello-world`. The directory should at least contain the *package.json*, *index.js*, and the *node_modules* folder.

## More Information

Generators allow you to have some scaffolding possibility directly embedded in your Piral Feed Service. This way, pilets can be created on a central place, following your templates and logic.
